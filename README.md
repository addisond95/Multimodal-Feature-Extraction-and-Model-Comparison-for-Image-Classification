# Multimodal-Feature-Extraction-and-Model-Comparison-for-Image-Classification
This project explores feature engineering, model development, and comparative performance analysis on the MNIST handwritten digits dataset. It demonstrates the end-to-end process of transforming raw image data into machine-learning-ready features and benchmarking multiple classification approaches.
